    "# Tracking User Engagement\n",
    "\n",
    "The first half of 2022 was expected to be profitable for the company. The reason was the hypothesized increased student engagement after the release of several new features on the companyâ€™s website at end-2021. These include enrolling in career tracks and testing your knowledge through practice, course, and career track exams. Of course, we have also expanded our course library to increase user engagement and the platformâ€™s audience as more topics are covered. By comparing different metrics, we can measure the effectiveness of these new features and the overall engagement of our users.\n",

    "1. **Calculating a Subscriptionâ€™s End Date** Use the `student_purchases` table from the data_scientist_project database to create a result set with the following columns:\n",
    "    - `purchase_id`\n",
    "    - `student_id`\n",

    "    - `date_start`\n",
    "    - `date_end`\n",
    "    - `date_refunded`\n",
    "The `date_start` column is the renamed `date_purchased` column from the database, adjusted for consistency with the subsequent `date_end` column.\n",
    "To calculate the end date of a subscription (`date_end`), add one month, three months, or 12 months to the start date of a subscription for a Monthly (represented as 0 in the `plan_id` column), Quarterly (1), or an Annual (2) purchase, respectively.\n",
    "The only exception is the lifetime subscription (denoted by 3), which has no end date. Refunds will be handled in the following task:   \n",
