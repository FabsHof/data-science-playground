    "\n",
    "1. [x] Import database dump from `db_course_conversions.sql` (done automatically ✅)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create a subquery with the following fields:\n",
    "- `student_id` – (int) the unique identification of a student\n",
    "- `date_registered` – (date) the date on which the student registered on the 365 platform\n",
    "- `first_date_watched` – (date) the date of first-time engagement\n",
    "- `first_date_purchased` – (date) the date of first-time purchase (NULL if they have no purchases)\n",
    "- `date_diff_reg_watch` – (int) the difference in days between the registration date and the date of first-time engagement\n",
    "- `date_diff_watch_purch` – (int) the difference in days between the date of first-time engagement and the date of first-time purchase (NULL if they have no purchases)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Calculate the following rates using the subquery:\n",
    "1. Free-to-Paid Conversion Rate:\n",
    "This metric measures the proportion of engaged students who choose to benefit from full course access on the 365 platform by purchasing a subscription after watching a lecture. It is calculated as the ratio between:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The number of students who watched a lecture and purchased a subscription on the same day or later.\n",
    "- The total number of students who have watched a lecture.\n",
    "Convert the result to percentages and call the field `conversion_rate`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Average Duration Between Registration and First-Time Engagement:\n",
    "This metric measures the average duration between the date of registration and the date of first-time engagement. This will tell us how long it takes, on average, for a student to watch a lecture after registration. The metric is calculated by finding the ratio between:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The sum of all such durations.\n",
    "- The count of these durations, or alternatively, the number of students who have watched a lecture.\n",
    "Call the field `av_reg_watch`.\n",

    "3. Average Duration Between First-Time Engagement and First-Time Purchase:\n",
    "This metric measures the average time it takes individuals to subscribe to the platform after viewing a lecture. It is calculated by dividing:\n",

    "- The count of these durations, or alternatively, the number of students who have made a purchase.\n",
